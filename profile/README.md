## Data Destruction

Data-security is no longer a buzz-phrase, it is a daily, foundational concern. At NCS Global, meeting your demand for effective, compliant, and secure data destruction is our mission. That is why we continually invest in our proprietary EcoErase software and data destruction processes ensuring your data remains out of unwanted hands. 

NCS uses a proprietary erasure software, EcoErase™, to ensure safe, reliable and certified destruction of customer data. The same software used in our data destruction process can be deployed on-site, giving you the power to safely manage the erasure of your sensitive data. EcoErase automates erasure and testing for HDD’s and SSD’s. The software’s deployment flexibility and ability to scale as customer’s data security needs grow is what sets EcoErase apart from other wiping software.

- NIST & DoD Certified, Independently Verified
- Customizable deployment methods
- Flexible enough to perform as many wipe cycles as required
- Onsite network through a dedicated server
- Hybrid cloud solution for remote data erasure
